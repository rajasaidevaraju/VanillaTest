This app is written using fastify as a framework for node server. It is mainly created to explore vanila java script and it's development path compared to frameworks such as angular and react. I am starting to appreciate the various features in frameworks such as routing and data binding.

to run, open cmd at the folder and type,

cd backend node server.js
